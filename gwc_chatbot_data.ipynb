It offers after-school clubs, summer programs, and college-level initiatives that teach programming skills, web development, and other tech competencies. By fostering a supportive and inclusive environment, GWC aims to build confidence in girls and increase their participation in computer science, thereby addressing the gender imbalance in the tech industry and inspiring future female leaders.',\n",
        "        'In Girls Who Code, you\\'ll complete numerous projects that can strengthen your college applications. Additionally, the sisterhood within GWC will give you a sense of belonging in a male-dominated field, helping you develop teamwork skills and grow your passion for computer science alongside other girls.',\n",
        "        'Python is a great language for beginners and ties in well with the AI and web development topics we’ll cover later in the year. For AP CS A students, re-learning Java in Girls Who Code would be redundant.',\n",
        "        'Our secretary, Emily, and PR officer, Stephanie, have both taken AP CS P, so feel free to reach out to them if you need help. The vice president, Amruta, and president, Grace, have both taken AP CS A. We’ll hold study sessions, share test-taking strategies, and provide study materials for both AP CS A and AP CS P a month before the AP exams.',\n",
